# Data Science Project: Heart Disease Prediction

## Introduction
This project uses data from the Kaggle, a popular data science web-based platform. \
The data set: [Predicting Heart Disease Using Clinical Variables](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/predicting-heart-disease-risk-using-clinical-var) \
In brief, it's a 270-Patient Dataset with 13 Features by [Robert Hoyt MD](https://data.world/rhoyt) \

This dataset provides **13 independent attributes**, the following description is modified from the [Column part of the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/predicting-heart-disease-risk-using-clinical-var/data): \
